# Reproducibility for A Modified VAR-deGARCH Model for Asynchronous Multivariate Financial Time Series via Variational Bayesian Inference
This folder contains the R code for the Variational Bayesian Inference function for the Modified VAR-deGARCH (M-VAR-deGARCH) Model.

* This code can reproduce all the simulation results in Section 4.
  + The required R packages include `mvtnorm`, `gtools`, `boot`, `psych`, `Matrix`, `MCMCpack`, `MASS`, `RColorBrewer`, `lattice`, `gridExtra`, `ggplot2`, and `grid`.
  + The `Simulation.R` script reproduces the results from Section 4. The true coefficients are found in `BetaCoef_m20.csv`, and the data from 100 replications is available in `Datam20_rep100.csv`.
  + The data file `Datam20_rep100.csv` can be generated by using `Data Ganeration.R`.
  + To run the code in `Simulation.R`, we must first execute `VB_NAR.R`, `predict.VB_NAR.R`, and `TPR_FPR_TCR.R`.
  + Since running 100 replications can be time-consuming, the result of the 100th replication is displayed in `Simulation.R`.
* The code can reproduce all the simulation results in Section 5.
  + The required R packages include `mvtnorm`, `gtools`, `boot`, `psych`, `Matrix`, `MCMCpack`, `MASS`, `RColorBrewer`, `lattice`, `gridExtra`, `ggplot2`, and `grid`.
  + The `Empirical Study.R` script reproduces the results from Section 5. The data in `Empirical.csv`, which is degarch and normalized data.
  + The degarch method is proposed by the Huang et al. (2021)
  + The Table 2 $(I(\boldsymbol{A}_0))$ is the data in `adjma.csv`
  + To run the code in `Empirical Study.R`, we must first execute `VB_NAR.R` and `predict.VB_NAR.R`.
  + Since running all cases can be time-consuming, the result of training period M1 for M-VAR-deGARCH, VAR-deGARCH, and ARMA-GARCH are displayed in `Empirical Study.R`.
