Description: Tools for data analysis with modified VAR-deGARCH (M-VAR-deGARCH) models. Specifically, the function provides facilities for implementing general structural time series models, fitting them to multivariate time series data, and conducting feature selection on the regression component.
             VB-NAR: 
                The input to the algorithm in VB-NAR
                  Y: Matrix-type of multivariate time series.
                  X: Matrix-type explanatory variables can be constructed as either (Y_{t}, Y_{t-1}, ..., Y_{t-p}) or (Y_{t-1}, Y_{t-2}, ..., Y_{t-p}). If X is not specified, it will be automatically generated based on the implied model.
                  segment: Group structure, where we consider no grouping structure and set it as c(1,1,...,1).
                  adj: 
                  lag: Number of lags. 
                  maxit:
                  tol:
                  phi_initial:
                  alpha_initial:
                  mu_initial:
                  sigma_initial:
                  sigma_beta_initial:
                  verbose: When 'verbose' is set to T, the model will show the information about the segment, sample size, and number of lags.
                  current: The modifier 'current' denotes whether this model incorporates the most recent information. When 'current' is set to T, the model considers the latest data and employs the M-VAR-deGARCH model. Conversely, when 'current' is set to F, it employs the VAR-deGARCH model.

                  The indicator variable current in  The output will be the coefficient matrix, the probability of active variable, and the estimate of variance and covariance matrix.
             
             predict.VB_NAR: 
                The input to our algorithm in predict.VB_NAR needs an output of the VB-NAR algorithm, matrix of testing data, rolling window size, and number of one step ahead in each testing time series. The output will be the estimate of multivariate time series, and the estimate of coefficient matrix.
             TPR_FPR_TCR: 
                The input to our algorithm in TPR_FPR_TCR needs a true coefficient matrix, the estimate of the coefficient matrix, and the number of replications. The output will be TPR, FPR, TNR, TCR, the number of true active variables, and the mean estimate of active variables.
