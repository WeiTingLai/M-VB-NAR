Description: Tools for data analysis with modified VAR-deGARCH (M-VAR-deGARCH) models. Specifically, the function provides facilities for implementing general structural time series models, fitting them to multivariate time series data, and conducting feature selection on the regression component.

             VB-NAR: 
                The input to the function VB-NAR:
                  Y: Matrix-type of multivariate time series.
                  X: Matrix-type explanatory variables can be constructed as either (Y_{t}, Y_{t-1}, ..., Y_{t-p}) or (Y_{t-1}, Y_{t-2}, ..., Y_{t-p}). If X is not specified, it will be automatically generated based on the implied model.
                  segment: Group structure, where we consider no grouping structure and set it as c(1,1,...,1).
                  adj: The indicator matrices, where the elements with 0 values represent the constraints that the associated coefficients in A_{0} and A_{p}, respectively, must be 0. In contrast, the elements with 1 denote potentially active variables in the associated coefficient matrices. This matrix is ​​restricted to an upper triangular matrix. If adj is not defined, the function is automatically set as an upper triangular matrix.
                  lag: Number of lags. 
                  maxit: Maximum iteration. The number of maximum iterations want to set. The default is 1e+5.
                  tol: Stopping criterion, the stopping criterion is that the value difference of $L(q)$ in two consecutive iterations is less than a tol. The default is 1e-8. 
                  phi_initial: Initial settings for activity variables. If phi_initial is not set, the function will set all elements to 1.
                  alpha_initial: The initial setting of the prior parameters for the indicator variables Ber(\pi_1) and Ber(\pi_2). If alpha_initial is not set, the function will set c(0.5, 0.5).
                  mu_initial: The initial setting of the coefficient matrix. If mu_initial is not set, the function will use the LSE method to estimate the coefficient matrix.
                  sigma_initial: The initial setting of noise. If sigma_initial is not set, the function will use the variance of time series.
                  sigma_beta_initial: The initial setting of the prior parameters for the variance about coefficient. If sigma_beta_initial is not set, the function will use the same value as sigma_initial.
                  verbose: When 'verbose' is set to T, the model will show the information about the segment, sample size, and number of lags.
                  current: The modifier 'current' denotes whether this model incorporates the most recent information. When 'current' is set to T, the model considers the latest data and employs the M-VAR-deGARCH model. Conversely, when 'current' is set to F, it employs the VAR-deGARCH model. The default is F.
                The output to the function VB-NAR:
                  Lag: Number of lags.
                  Y: Matrix-type of multivariate time series.
                  X: Matrix-type explanatory variables can be constructed as either (Y_{t}, Y_{t-1}, ..., Y_{t-p}) or (Y_{t-1}, Y_{t-2}, ..., Y_{t-p}). If X is not specified, it will be automatically generated based on the implied model.
                  gamma_pos: The posterior probability of whether the off-diagonal coefficients are active variables.
                  eta_pos: The posterior probability of whether the diagonal coefficients are active variables.
                  segment: Group structure.
                  phi: The posterior probability of whether the coefficients are active variables.

                  step_ahead: The number of sample sizes you want to predict (how many one-step predictions you want to forecast). The default value is 1.
                  current: The modifier 'current' denotes whether this model incorporates the most recent information. When 'current' is set to T, the model considers the latest data and employs the M-VAR-deGARCH model. Conversely, when 'current' is set to F, it employs the VAR-deGARCH model. The default is F.
                  rolling: Whether want to roll the window or not. The default is T.
                  rolling_number: The rolling window size. The default is the size of the training set.
